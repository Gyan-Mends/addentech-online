# Task Assignment Display Debugging Guide

## Issue Description
Tasks can be assigned successfully, but the assignee names are not visible in the task list after assignment.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open your browser's developer console (F12) and look for these logs:

**Server-side logs:**
- `Assigning task: [taskId] to member: [memberId]` - Shows assignment is being attempted
- `Assignment result: {...}` - Shows if assignment succeeded
- `Sample task assignee data: [...]` - Shows what assignee data is being loaded

**Client-side logs:**
- `Client-side tasks data: [...]` - Shows what task data is received by the UI

### 2. Database Check
If you have database access, verify the assignment was saved:

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or database tool
db.tasks.findOne({_id: ObjectId("your-task-id")}, {assignedTo: 1, title: 1})
```

### 3. Test Assignment Flow

1. **Open Enhanced Tasks page:** `/admin/enhanced-tasks`
2. **Find a task** you can assign (must be department head, admin, or manager)
3. **Click "Assign" button** on any task
4. **Select a department member** from the dropdown
5. **Add optional instructions** and click "Assign Task"
6. **Check console** for debug logs
7. **Wait for page refresh** (should happen automatically after 200ms)
8. **Look for assignee name** in the "Assigned To" column

### 4. Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:**
- Assignment modal opens ✓
- User can select a member ✓  
- Assignment succeeds (check console for success message) ✓
- Page refreshes automatically ✓
- Assignee name appears in "Assigned To" column ❌ (THIS IS THE ISSUE)

**What might be wrong:**
1. **Database not saving:** Assignment API fails
2. **Population failing:** assignedTo field not populating with user details
3. **UI rendering issue:** Data exists but UI not displaying correctly
4. **Timing issue:** Page refreshing before database update completes

### 5. Troubleshooting Commands

**Check if task assignment saved to database:**
```bash
# Connect to your MongoDB and run:
db.tasks.find({assignedTo: {$exists: true, $ne: []}}, {title: 1, assignedTo: 1}).pretty()
```

**Check if user population is working:**
```bash
# In your application, try this query manually:
const task = await Task.findById('your-task-id').populate('assignedTo', 'firstName lastName email');
console.log('Populated assignees:', task.assignedTo);
```

### 6. Quick Fixes to Try

**Option 1: Increase refresh delay**
In `app/routes/admin.enhanced-tasks.tsx`, line ~240, change:
```javascript
}, 200); // Try 500 or 1000
```

**Option 2: Force full page reload**
Replace the navigation with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload();
}, 500);
```

**Option 3: Check task loading filter**
The issue might be in role-based filtering. Make sure the task you're assigning to is included in the user's view permissions.

### 7. Contact Information
If the issue persists after these steps, provide:
1. Console log output
2. Database query results
3. User role performing the assignment
4. Specific task ID being assigned
