# Task Assignment Display Issue - Debug Guide

## Problem
Tasks can be assigned but assignee names don't show up in the task list.

## What I've Fixed

1. **Added comprehensive logging** to track assignment process
2. **Improved page refresh** timing (200ms delay instead of 1500ms)
3. **Added client-side debugging** to see what data is received

## Debug Steps

### 1. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these logs when assigning a task:

**Server logs:**
- "Assigning task: [id] to member: [id]"
- "Assignment result: {success: true/false}"
- "Sample task assignee data: [...]"

**Client logs:**
- "Client-side tasks data: [array of tasks with assignee info]"

### 2. Test Assignment
1. Go to `/admin/enhanced-tasks`
2. Click "Assign" on any task
3. Select a member and click "Assign Task"
4. Check console for logs
5. Page should refresh in 200ms
6. Look for assignee name in "Assigned To" column

### 3. If Still Not Working

Try increasing the refresh delay in `app/routes/admin.enhanced-tasks.tsx` around line 240:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    navigate(`/admin/enhanced-tasks?${new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)}`, {
        replace: true
    });
}, 500); // Change from 200 to 500 or 1000
```

Or use full page reload:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload();
}, 500);
```

## Files Modified
- `app/controller/task.tsx` - Added assignment logging
- `app/routes/admin.enhanced-tasks.tsx` - Added debugging and improved refresh
