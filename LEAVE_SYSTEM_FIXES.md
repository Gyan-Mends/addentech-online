# Leave Management System - Recent Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Staff Role Filtering ✅
- **Problem**: Staff could see all leaves instead of just their own
- **Fix**: Re-enabled role-based filtering in `LeaveController.getLeaves()`
- **Location**: `app/controller/leave.tsx` lines 120-135

### 2. Approval/Rejection Status Mapping ✅
- **Problem**: Frontend was sending 'approve'/'reject' but backend expected 'approved'/'rejected'
- **Fix**: Updated `handleSubmitApproval()` to map status correctly
- **Location**: `app/routes/admin.leave-management.tsx` line 205

### 3. Email Notification System ✅
- **Features Added**:
  - Leave reminder emails for leaves ending tomorrow
  - Approval/rejection notification emails
  - Email service with console logging (for testing)
  - Manual trigger system via admin interface

### 4. Email Reminder Infrastructure ✅
- **Files Created**:
  - `app/services/emailService.ts` - Email service class
  - `app/routes/api.leave-reminders.tsx` - API endpoint for reminders
  - `app/routes/admin.leave-reminders.tsx` - Admin interface for testing
- **Schema Updates**: Added `reminderSent` and `reminderSentAt` fields to Leave model

### 5. Debugging Enhancements ✅
- Added comprehensive logging to action functions
- Added status tracking in approval workflow
- Added automatic page reload after successful actions

## How to Use

### Manual Reminder Testing
1. Go to `/admin/leave-reminders`
2. Click "Send Leave Reminders Now"
3. Check console logs for results

### Automated Reminders
Set up a cron job to POST to `/api/leave-reminders` daily:
```bash
# Run at 9 AM daily
0 9 * * * curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/leave-reminders
```

### Email Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Permission System

### Staff Role
- Can only see their own leave applications
- Can apply for new leaves
- Can edit/delete their own leaves (if no admin action taken)

### Department Head Role
- Can see all leaves from their department
- Can approve/reject department leaves
- Can apply for their own leaves

### Admin/Manager Role

## Next Steps
