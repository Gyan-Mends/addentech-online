## System Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Leave Controller (`app/controller/leave.tsx`)
Handles all leave-related business logic:
- Create new leave applications
- Retrieve leaves with filtering
- Update leave status (approve/reject)
- Calculate statistics
- Export functionality

#### 2. API Routes
- `app/routes/api.leaves.tsx` - Main CRUD operations
- `app/routes/api.leaves.export.tsx` - CSV export functionality

#### 3. Database Schema
MongoDB schema with the following key fields:
```typescript
{
  employee: ObjectId,
  leaveType: String,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  totalDays: Number,
  reason: String,
  status: String, // pending, approved, rejected
  priority: String, // low, normal, high, urgent
  approvalWorkflow: Array,
  department: ObjectId,
  submissionDate: Date,
  lastModified: Date
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Admin Dashboard (`app/routes/admin.leave-management.tsx`)
- Statistics cards showing key metrics
- Filterable table of all applications
- Approval/rejection modal
- Export functionality

#### 2. Employee Application Form (`app/routes/employee-leave-application.tsx`)
- User-friendly form with validation
- Date picker with business logic
- Automatic calculation of leave days
- Leave policy information

#### 3. Leave Detail View (`app/routes/admin.leave.$id.tsx`)
- Complete application details
- Approval timeline
- Comments and history

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/leaves`
Retrieve leave applications with optional filters:
- `status`: Filter by approval status
- `leaveType`: Filter by leave type
- `department`: Filter by department
- `page`: Pagination
- `limit`: Results per page

### POST `/api/leaves`
Create a new leave application or update existing ones:
- Set `_method=POST` for creation

## Statistics & Metrics

The dashboard provides real-time statistics:
- **Total Applications**: All submitted applications
- **Pending Approvals**: Applications awaiting approval
- **Approved This Month**: Monthly approval count
- **Rejected This Month**: Monthly rejection count
- **Upcoming Leaves**: Approved future leaves
- **On Leave Today**: Current active leaves

## Customization

### Adding New Leave Types
1. Update the enum in the database schema
2. Add the new type to the frontend select options
3. Update validation rules if needed

### Modifying Approval Workflow

2. Update the approval logic in the controller
3. Modify the frontend approval interface

### Custom Reporting
1. Extend the export functionality
2. Add new statistical calculations
3. Create custom dashboard widgets

## Security Features

- **Authentication**: Session-based user authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on both client and server
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated for performance
- **Indexing**: Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for statistics
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Applications Not Showing**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify user permissions
   - Check filter settings

2. **Export Not Working**
   - Ensure proper authentication
