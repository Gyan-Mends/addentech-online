## Test Steps

### 1. Test Assignment as HOD

1. **Login as Department Head**
2. **Go to Enhanced Tasks** (`/admin/enhanced-tasks`)
3. **Open Browser Console (F12)** to see debug logs
4. **Find a task** that needs assignment
5. **Click "Assign" button**
6. **Check console** for: `ðŸ‘¥ Department users for HOD: [list of users]`
7. **Select a department member** from dropdown
8. **Check console** for: `ðŸŽ¯ User selected in modal: [user-id]`
9. **Add optional instructions** 
10. **Click "Assign Task"**
11. **Check console** for detailed assignment logs:
    - `Submitting assignment:`
    - `ðŸ”„ Starting hierarchical assignment:`
    - `ðŸ“‹ Database lookup results:`
12. **Wait for success message** and page refresh
13. **Verify assignee appears** in task list with role indicators

### 2. Check Assignment History

1. **Click "View" on the assigned task**
2. **Go to task details page**
3. **Look for "Assignment History" section**
4. **Should now show**:
   ```
   Assignment History
   John Doe assigned to Jane Smith
   6/7/2025 at 5:16:33 PM (Delegated)
   "your instructions here"
   ```

### 3. Expected Console Output

**When loading page:**
```
ðŸ‘¥ Department users for HOD: ["John Doe (staff)", "Jane Smith (staff)", ...]
```

**When selecting user:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ User selected in modal: 64f7b1234567890abcdef123
ðŸŽ¯ Selected user details: {_id: "64f7b1234567890abcdef123", firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith", ...}
```

**When submitting assignment:**
```
Submitting assignment:
- Selected task: 64f7b1234567890abcdef456
- Assigned member ID: 64f7b1234567890abcdef123
- Instructions: "Please complete this by end of week"
- Available users: [array of users]

ðŸ”„ Starting hierarchical assignment:
- Task ID: 64f7b1234567890abcdef456
- New Assignee ID: 64f7b1234567890abcdef123
- Assigned By User ID (email): john.doe@company.com
- Instructions: "Please complete this by end of week"

ðŸ“‹ Database lookup results:
- Task found: true "Sample Task Title"
- Assigned by user found: true "John Doe"
- New assignee found: true "Jane Smith"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No assigned member selected!" in console
- **Solution**: Make sure to select a user from the dropdown before clicking assign

### Issue: Assignment history shows "assigned to" without names
- **Solution**: This is now fixed! The populate queries have been added

### Issue: Empty user dropdown
- **Check**: Console should show department users list
- **Verify**: HOD is in the correct department
- **Confirm**: Department has active staff members
